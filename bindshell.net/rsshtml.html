			<title>Ruby BeEF Port Development Progress</title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/75</link>
			<description> The ruby port of BeEF is currently in code freeze. The 0.4.1 alpha version of this port will be available shortly for download.   Recent development has focused on the UI and the new install process. You will notice a great difference. All functionality from the PHP version is yet to be fully ported. This and the next few releases will be concerned mainly with stability and building a flexible framework. The porting of all functionality is still a few releases away.   To get a copy of the current development version from the svn, run:  svn checkout http://beef.googlecode.com/svn/branches/RBeEF beef  </description>

			<title>BeEF PHP Settings</title>
			<link>http://bindshell.net/entry/68</link>
			<description> PHP in Fedora (Fedora 12 at least) has the short_open_tag turned off by default. In this state it will cause an error if you try to use BeEF. Thanks to Steve 'Ashcrow' Milner for pointing this out.  To fix this try the following change to the /etc/php.ini file:  -short_open_tag = Off  +short_open_tag = On  </description>
